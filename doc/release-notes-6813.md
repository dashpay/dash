EvoDB migration
---------------

This release automatically handles migration from legacy masternode state diff format to a new one which should make future state diff upgrades seamless. No manual intervention required for node operators. This operation is irreversible and you'd have to reindex if you decide to downgrade to a previous version. #6813
